# 1.2 - Cloud Datastore

Cloud Datastore is a highly-scalable NoSQL database.

## Introduction
### Design specifics
* **Data locality**: Datastore is designed in a way where you can choose which documents live near which other documents by putting them in the same entity group. Queries inside a single entity group are strongly consistent.
* **Result-set query scale**: Datastore uses indexing to accomplish just this, so that if your query has 10 matches, itâ€™ll take the same amount of time regardless of whether you have 1 GB or 1 PB of e-mail data.
* **Automatic replication**: Any data written should be automatically replicated to many different physical servers
